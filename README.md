# Try it
```
git clone https://github.com/rui-infotrack/tryvue.git
cd tryvue
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
gulp
DEBUG=tryvue:* npm start
```

Then open localhost:3000 in your browser

- The server is express, but you can ignore as it's not the point. I use it to host HTML and JS.
- The most important things are `.vue` files, `gulpfile.js`, and `package.json`
